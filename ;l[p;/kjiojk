    Conjure 
    to work away not understanding
    conjure to sleep for      eight actual hours
    but nervously wake-wake    all thru the night.
    Conjure boredom.  Conjure “hold.”
    your call is [very=sincere] important to us.
    To leave a messy, press two. Press
    one. Please [garble] customer
    service representative. Please
    Stay. Leave a me-say.
    
    Pleas wait.
    It is ejecting. Wait for reset.
    Then you can plead your case.
    
    Play-hold; we are accessing your file
    (“file” spelled as reverse of “life”).
    No, we don’t handle that question.
    Try the following Numbing.
    
    Do you have a pencil?
    Are you ready?
    I will repeat.
    
    Wait for the joke of drought and choke. 
    Then wait for decent water. 
    Wait for an official statement.
    
    This machine is empty.
    It is out of quarters. Gives no quarter.
    No change. [Unclear] refilled.
    
    This office is [garbled] until further notice.
    Please wait for restocking.
    We are checking. 
    
    Conjure “hold on.”
    We can’t just conjure
    the codes from nothing! We can’t work
